From 2009-2018, I was a researcher in linguistics, specializing in:

+ **phonetics** (the study of perception and production of speech sounds),
+ **psycholinguistics** (the study of real-time language processing, and how language interacts with cognitive processes), and
+ **neurolinguistics** (the study of the structure and function of the brain as it affects language use).

This page is an overview of some of my primary projects during that time. You can find a full list of my published work <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4vfpQcMAAAAJ&hl=en">here</a>. A handful of these projects have example code <a href = "https://github.com/ecibelli?tab=repositories">hosted on GitHub</a>.

**Speech biomarkers of mental illness**

Can speech be used as a diagnostic tool in clinical psychology? Psychotic disorders like schizophrenia impact motor control, affecting posture and head and limb movement. There's also some evidence for motor/motion disruptions in young adults who are at *risk* for these disorders, but haven't yet been diagnosed. Because speaking depends on a high degree of motor control, it's plausible that these motor disruptions also impact speech. If so, the voice may represent an early warning, non-invasive tool to detct psychosis risk in young adults.

**Automatic speech tools to detect cognitive disruptions**

Do cognitive challenges (e.g. speaking a second language, being an older speaker) leave detectible signs in speech? This project attempts to answer this by developing and using automatic processing algorithms to detect subtle variations in speech. These subtle hints in pronunciation  may indicate that a speaker has a more demanding cognitive task than usual in finding the right word or putting a sentence together.
