Hi there! I'm Emily, a linguist by training who currently works in data analysis in the non-profit education sector. This page mostly has information about my professional work, but there's some personal tidbits too.

**Update, May 2020**: I will be moving back to the San Francisco Bay Area in September 2020, and will be looking for a new position at that time (both Bay Area and remote roles). I'm open to a variety of roles in tech, research, higher ed, and the non-profit/advocacy world. If you'd like to connect about opportunities, please reach out!
