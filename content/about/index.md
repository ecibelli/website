I was raised in <a href = "https://www.nutleynj.org/">a small Jersey town</a> (exit 151), a location which provided me with a view of the Manhattan skyline, a rich inventory of American English vowels, and enough pizzerias to <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4706670">incite war</a>. After distinguishing myself through <a href="https://highschoolsports.nj.com/school/nutley-nutley/girlsbowling/">hardy athletic pursuits</a> and participating in musical groups that <a href="https://www.cedarpoint.com/">expanded my cultural horizons</a>, I left the Garden State for college.

While at Wellesley, I studied <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/cogsci">cognitive and linguistic sciences</a>, and got my start in research with labs <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/cogsci/lab">on</a> and <a href="https://www.harvardlds.org/">off</a> campus. In my spare time, I danced in <a href="http://ballroom.mit.edu/">ballroom competitions</a>, hung out at the <a href = "https://www.wellesley.edu/astronomy/whitin">observatory</a>, played the <a href = "https://www.wellesley.edu/music/performanceprogram/ensembles/carillon">carillon</a>, met <a href="randyo.net">this guy</a>, and found myself in tunnels of both the <a href="https://thewellesleynews.com/2016/03/09/wellesley-legends-students-recount-the-colleges-popular-myths-and-ghost-stories/">steam</a> and <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/about/collegehistory/traditions/marathonmonday">scream</a> varieties. In my junior year, I spent the spring studying at <a href = "http://www.nuigalway.ie/">Galway</a>, where I developed a taste for garlic chips and <a href="https://monroes.ie/">Murphy's</a>, and decided that umbrellas aren't very useful.

In 2009, I bid the East Coast <a href="https://www.dunkindonuts.com/en">a bittersweet farewell</a> and headed west for <a href="https://lx.berkeley.edu/">grad school</a>. Despite being that asshole that complained about missing winter, I grew to love the <a href="https://www.berkeleybowl.com/">endless produce</a> and <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/inspiration-point-to-wildcat-peak">hilly vistas</a> of California. When I wasn't in the lab, you could sometimes find me playing frisbee with my fellow Berkeley linguists (go Huckin' Wugs!)

In 2015, our intrepid '94 Camry wagon carted me <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HUiszm3fpGcEmuvi6">2000 miles to Chicago</a>, to pay my <a href="https://news.wttw.com/2019/01/30/dangerous-beauty-chiberia">winter debt</a>. I spent three years as a <a href="http://groups.linguistics.northwestern.edu/soundlab/v2/#!/">postdoc</a> and lecturer at Northwestern. These days, I spend my days as a data analyst focused on <a href="https://www.ingenuity-inc.org/">arts education</a> in city schools. Outside of work, you'll find me cooking, shortwave radio listening, <a href="https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/315792270">running</a>, and <a href= "https://www.ravelry.com/people/anylit/">knitting</a> on the brown line.
