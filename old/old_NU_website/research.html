<b>Speech biomarkers of mental illness</b><br>

Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are known to impact motor control circuits. Effects of this disruption are observable in head and limb movement both in individuals diagnosed with such a disorder, and to some extent in young adults who are at high risk, but have not yet received a diagnosis. It is plausible that these disruptions also impact speech motor control; evidence of such an effect could point to speech as a novel biomarker for psychotic disorders, ultimately facilitating early intervention. In this project, we are using automatic phonetic analysis tools to process a corpus of spoken data from high-risk youth to look for prosodic and phonetic correlates of motor control disruptions in speech in this population.</p><p>

This project is comprised of a set of studies designed to investigate cognitive control of lexical access during speech production. We use phonetic properties of speech produced in the lab to look for traces of lexical competition in populations which may be particularly susceptible to the cognitive demands of competition: older speakers, and bilinguals. In addition to our theoretical goals, this project is also concerned with the development of tools to automatically align speech and generate phonetic measurements for rapid processing of speech production data.

<b>Tongue twisters and articulatory variability</b><br> 
<i>Collaborators:  Erin Madigan, Gia Eapen, <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/matt-goldrick/">Matt Goldrick</a> </i></p><p>
This project looks at the articulatory variability inherent in speech production data generated during tongue twister tasks. Our study is aimed to test and replicate existing effects indicating that multiple phonetic targets are active and leave traces in articulation during twister repetition. In addition, we plan to test the effects of different baseline tasks on the extent of articulatory varability reported in these tasks, and to compare different approaches to modeling this varaibility on a single data set.

With collaborators at the <a href="http://labs.feinberg.northwestern.edu/slutzky/">Feinberg School of Medicine</a>, we are looking at speech motor control data from intracranial recordings (electrocorticography, or ECoG) taken from sites in and aroun the speech motor cortex. One current focus is on the representation of allophones, and how phonological contexts which neutralize a phonemic contrast pattern with respect to un-neutralized phones. -->

Current and former members of the <a href="http://lclab.berkeley.edu/">Language and Cognition Lab</a> and the <a href="http://cocosci.berkeley.edu/">Computational Cognitive Science Lab</a> at Berkeley are probing the nature and stability of color categorization and perception. We're testing categorical effects on color perception within a Bayesian framework in order to better understand how perceivers handle stimuli that are prototypical or marginal members of categories.

<b>Acquisition of non-native phonemes</b>
</p><p>
The sound system of your native language strongly influences the structure of your speech perception and production systems. In some cases, this can make it challenging to acquire sounds in a new language. In my dissertation, I explored the types of information that can contribute to the stable acquisition of a new phonemic category in a second language, and how those novel categories are represented neurally.

Our team developed a longitudinal corpus of speech from the Up Series, a set of documentaries which have interviewed several individuals in Britain every seven years since the age of seven. The corpus provides source material to investigate the development of speech over the entire lifespan, with particular attention to the understudied productions of middle-age speakers.</p><p>

<b>Heritage language attrition and reclamation</b><br> 
</p><p>
I worked with heritage speakers of the dialect of Finnish spoken by Americans of Finnish descent (variously known as "Finglish," <i>fingelska</i>, and <i>amerikansuomi</i>). In addition to documenting lexical items that vary from standard Finnish, I measured the phonetic qualities of the speech of heritage speakers who are relearning Finnish in adulthood. The goal was to examine what native-like phonetic aspects of the phonological system are maintained as a function of early childhood exposure, even when the language has not been used for long periods in adulthood.</p><p>

<b>Phonetic convergence in bilinguals</b>
</p><p>
At Wellesley, I conducted a behavioral study which measured the degree of phonetic convergence to a speaker with a non-native accent. Participants included monolingual English speakers, balanced English-Spanish bilinguals, and bilinguals with one language more dominant than the other, in order to determine the extent to which language history and dominance influenced the tendency to converge to accented speech.
