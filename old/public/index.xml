      <description>I was raised in a small Jersey town(exit 151), a location which provided me with a view of the Manhattan skyline, a rich inventory of American English vowels, and enough pizzerias to incite war. After distinguishing myself through hardy athletic pursuitsand participating in musical groups that expanded my cultural horizons, I left the Garden State for college.
While at Wellesley, I studied cognitive and linguistic sciences, and got my start in research with labs onand offcampus.</description>

      <description>From 2009-2018, I was a researcher in linguistics, specializing in:
 phonetics (the study of the perception and production of speech sounds), psycholinguistics (the study of real-time language processing, and how language and cognition affect one another), and neurolinguistics (the study of the structure and function of the brain as it affects language).  This page is an overview of some of my projects during that time. You can find a full list of my published work here.</description>
