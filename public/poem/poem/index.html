      <h3 id="the-ballad-of-marco-polo">The Ballad of Marco Polo</h3>
<p><em>Stephen Vincent Benét</em></p>
<p>I stumbled across this poem in a 10th grade literary anthology (possibly 
<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Book_of_Poetry_1.html?id=IWU1FdGqXBIC&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a>
?) At the time, I was in the short-lived habit of typing up poems I liked, so this one got saved to my old family computer, along with a few other favorites. I found it a few years later and was equally charmed, and looked it up to see what other information I could gather. But despite SVB&rsquo;s significant legacy, the poem itself is barely documented anywhere online - at the moment, just a handful of citations referencing the original issue of the Atlantic Monthly in which it was published.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no literary academic, but I haven&rsquo;t had luck finding any scholarly traces of it either; in fact, it didn&rsquo;t even appear in any of the Benét anthologies I&rsquo;ve looked through. I&rsquo;m reproducing it here because I&rsquo;m utterly fond of it - probably more so because I&rsquo;ve constructed a bit of a mystery in my head about its lack of notoriety - and feel it should have a bit more attention and web presence. If you know something about the poem, or enjoyed it as much as I do, please be in touch. (I hear from about one person a year, and it&rsquo;s a treat!)</p>
<p>&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
<p><em>Marco Polo, curious man,</em><br>
<em>What drove you to seek that Kublai Khan?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it was youth, for I was young,<br>
Perhaps it was my father&rsquo;s tongue<br>
The desert hawk I had never seen<br>
Till the years of my age were turned fifteen,<br>
For I was not born when he went away<br>
To trade beyond the rim of day,<br>
And, when he returned, we were strange and shy,<br>
Meeting each other, he and I,<br>
For a lost bride&rsquo;s eyes looked out at him,<br>
My mother&rsquo;s, who died in bearing me,<br>
And the lines of his visage were great and grim<br>
And I knew he had been in Tartary.</p>
<p><em>Marco Polo, how did it fall</em><br>
<em>That at last you followed him, after all?</em></p>
<p>When the world shut in with candlelight,<br>
They would talk to each other, night on night,<br>
While the water lapped at the landing stair<br>
And they hardly knew that I was there<br>
Except as a shadow the candle threw<br>
When the wind before the morning blew<br>
And the great house creaked like a ship of stone,<br>
Maffeo and Nicolo,<br>
Talking of marvels past reknown,<br>
Talking of wonders still to do -<br>
Their talk was honey and wine and snow<br>
How could I help but drink it down?<br>
How could I help but thirst and burn,<br>
When the opened the bag of camel&rsquo;s hair<br>
And looked at the marvel hidden there<br>
And said, &ldquo;It is time and we must return?&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>Marco Polo, what did you see,</em><br>
<em>When at length you came to Tartary?</em></p>
<p>I know I have been where I have been,<br>
But how can I tell you what I have seen?<br>
I know the desert of the dry tree<br>
Whose branches bear eternity,<br>
And the hot sickness of the noon.<br>
I drank the mare&rsquo;s milk of the tents,<br>
I saw the musk ox gape at me,<br>
I have had gold and frankincense<br>
And silks that glitter like the moon,<br>
But what can I tell you that will make you see?<br>
Marco Polo, wandering sword<br>
What manner of man did you call lord?<br>
I have been the pope&rsquo;s and doge&rsquo;s man,<br>
But I never knew master like Kublai Khan.<br>
The sons of his body sit ten by ten<br>
At buffets of precious napery,<br>
When he hunts, he hunts with ten thousand men<br>
And his Tartar falcons darken the sky,<br>
He has jewels uncounted and golden plate<br>
Whence even his meanest slaves may eat,<br>
And he sits and numbers the hairs of fate<br>
With a great, tame lion crouched at his feet,<br>
And his mercy as fair as a white ram&rsquo;s fleece,<br>
Mighty in battle and just in peace,<br>
Star of the city of Kanbalu,<br>
Khan of Khans and Great of the Great<br>
Whose bounty falls like the morning dew -<br>
Since Adam delved and Eve span<br>
Who ever saw a prince like Kublai Khan?</p>
<p><em>Marco Polo, tell me how</em><br>
<em>Your Venice talks of your travels now?</em></p>
<p>They call me braggart, they call me liar,<br>
They gawk at me like an eater of fire,<br>
&lsquo;Millions&rsquo; Polo, the fable-monger,<br>
Such being his custom in Cathay.<br>
But they laughed with their beards another way,<br>
When we came back in &lsquo;95<br>
Like ghosts returned to a world alive,<br>
With our gear still smelling of musk and civet<br>
And my father&rsquo;s beard grown whiter than privet,<br>
Two old men and a younger one<br>
Who had looked in the eye of the Eastern sun.<br>
And lived - and lived to tell the tale<br>
Which I tell to the shadows in this, my jail.<br>
Why, my very cousins did not own us<br>
And the jeering crowd was ready to stone us<br>
Till we ripped the riches out of our rags<br>
And proved we were Polos - by moneybags!</p>
<p>Let them laugh as long as they like today!<br>
I have seen Cathay, I have seen Cathay!<br>
Their little Europe - their dwarfish West -<br>
Their doge with his ring and marriage fee!<br>
I have stolen the eggs from the phoenix nest<br>
And walked by the shores of the Ocean-Sea,<br>
The earth-encircler, the Asian main,<br>
And, if Kublai lived, I would go again,<br>
For what is their quarrel of gimcrack lords,<br>
Their toy fleets sailing a herring pond,<br>
By the might that mastered the Tartar hordes?<br>
There are worlds beyond, there are worlds beyond,<br>
Worlds to be conquered, worlds to be found,<br>
By river and desert and burning ground,<br>
Even, perchance, by the Ocean-Sea,<br>
If a man has courage enough to dare,<br>
And I know that others will follow me<br>
And I mark the roads that will take them there,<br>
The roads of the golden caravan,<br>
The whole great East in its roaring youth,<br>
For - there was a prince named Kublai Khan -<br>
And I, the liar, have told the truth.</p>
