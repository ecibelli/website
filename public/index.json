From left: Nutley, NJ; Wellesley College, MA; Galway, Ireland; Berkeley, CA; Chicago, IL\nI was raised in a small Jersey town (exit 151), a location which provided me with a view of the Manhattan skyline, a rich inventory of American English vowels, and enough pizzerias to incite war. After distinguishing myself through hardy athletic pursuits and participating in musical groups that expanded my cultural horizons, I left the Garden State for college.\nWhile at Wellesley, I studied cognitive and linguistic sciences, and got my start in research with labs on and off campus. In my spare time, I danced in ballroom competitions, hung out at the observatory, played the carillon, met this guy, and found myself in tunnels of both the steam and scream varieties. In my junior year, I spent the spring studying at Galway, where I developed a taste for garlic chips and Murphy\u0026rsquo;s, and decided that umbrellas aren\u0026rsquo;t very useful.\nIn 2009, I bid the East Coast a bittersweet farewell and headed west for grad school. Despite being that asshole that complained about missing winter, I grew to love the endless produce and hilly vistas of California. When I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the lab, you could sometimes find me playing frisbee with my fellow Berkeley linguists (go Huckin\u0026rsquo; Wugs!)\nIn 2015, our intrepid \u0026lsquo;94 Camry wagon carted me 2000 miles to Chicago, to pay my winter debt. I spent three years as a postdoc and lecturer at Northwestern. These days, I spend my days as a data analyst focused on arts education in city schools. Outside of work, you\u0026rsquo;ll find me cooking, shortwave radio listening, running, and knitting on the brown line.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"The places I\u0026rsquo;ve called home.

This page is an overview of some of my projects during that time. You can find a full list of my published work here. A handful of these projects have example code hosted on GitHub.\n Speech biomarkers of mental illness\nCollaborators: Vijay Mittal, Matt Goldrick, Joseph Keshet\nCan speech be used as a diagnostic tool in clinical psychology? Psychotic disorders like schizophrenia impact motor control, affecting posture and head and limb movement. There\u0026rsquo;s also some evidence for motor/motion disruptions in young adults who are at risk for these disorders, but haven\u0026rsquo;t yet been diagnosed. Because speaking depends on a high degree of motor control, it\u0026rsquo;s plausible that these motor disruptions also impact speech. If so, the voice may represent an early warning, non-invasive tool to detect psychosis risk in young adults.\n Sichlinger, L., Cibelli, E., Goldrick, M., \u0026amp; Mittal, V. A. (2019). Clinical correlates of aberrant conversational turn-taking in youth at clinical high-risk for psychosis. Schizophrenia Research, 204, 419. Vargas, T., Osborne, K. J., Cibelli, E. S., \u0026amp; Mittal, V. A. (2019). Separating hearing sensitivity from auditory perceptual abnormalities in clinical high risk (CHR) youth. Schizophrenia Research, 204, 437-438. NIH 1R21MH119677-01A1  \r Acquiring speech sounds in a new language\nYour native language(s) has a big impact on how you perceive and pronounce speech sounds. In some cases, this can make it hard to acquire sounds in a new language, especially if you start learning as an adult. In my dissertation, I explored some different ways to teach adult learners challenging sounds in a new language, focusing both on auditory training (helping you hear the differences between new sounds) and articulatory training (helping you position your tongue, lips, and larynx to pronounce them).\n Cibelli, E. (2019). Training Non-Native Consonant Production with Perceptual and Articulatory Cues. Phonetica, 1-28. Find all the gory details in my dissertation.  \r Automatic detection of cognitive difficulty\nCollaborators: Matt Goldrick, Rhonda (McClain) Mudry, Joseph Keshet, Yossi Adi\nDo cognitive challenges (e.g. speaking a second language, being an older speaker) leave detectible signs in speech? This project attempts to answer this by developing and using automatic processing algorithms to detect subtle variations in speech. These subtle hints in pronunciation may indicate that a speaker has a more demanding cognitive task than usual in finding the right word or putting a sentence together.\n Goldrick, M., McClain, R., Cibelli, E., Adi, Y., Gustafson, E., Moers, C., \u0026amp; Keshet, J.

When it comes to color perception, your experience is sometimes (but not always!) affected by the language you speak. Our work in this domain suggests that you are most influenced by the categories in by your native language (\u0026ldquo;basic\u0026rdquo; color words like red, blue, and green) when cognitive demands are high. In those circumstances, we see speakers of different languages recalling and classifying the same color in different ways.\nCibelli, E., Xu, Y., Austerweil, J. L., Griffiths, T. L., \u0026amp; Regier, T. (2016). The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis and Probabilistic Inference: Evidence from the Domain of Color. PloS One, 11(7), e0158725. (*Co-first authors.)\n The neural pathways of word recognition\nCollaborators: Keith Johnson, Eddie Chang, Matt Leonard\nMeasuring neural activity during language processing is a challenge - in part because it happens so quickly and across wide networks of the brain. A technique called electocorticography (ECoG) allows a rare look into the simultaneous spatial and temporal dimensions of language processing. We used this approach to look at the neural pathways used to process real words and word-like nonsense forms (e.g. \u0026ldquo;tesolivy\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;piteretion\u0026rdquo;) millisecond by millisecond, and millimeter by millimeter.\nCibelli, E.S., Leonard, M.K., Johnson, K., \u0026 Chang, E.F. (2015). The influence of lexical statistics on temporal lobe cortical dynamics during spoken word listening. Brain and Language 147, 66-75.\r\r Speech and aging\nCollaborators: Susanne Gahl, Kat Hall, Ronald Sprouse\nWe know that the voice changes throughout childhood, and again late in life. But what happens during the longest span of life - early and middle adulthood? This question is a challenge to study, because it\u0026rsquo;s rare to have recordings of a person\u0026rsquo;s voice over many decades. To tackle this challenge, we measured speech from the Up! movies - a documentary series that has followed the same group of people every seven years of their lives. This corpus is freely available for language and speech researchers to use.\nGahl, S., Cibelli, E., Hall, K., and Sprouse, R. (2014). The \"Up\" corpus: A corpus of speech samples across adulthood.
