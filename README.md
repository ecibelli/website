Notes to myself to remember how to edit content within the hugo-academic/blogdown framework.

 - config.toml defines basic parameters such as theme, site name, language support, pagination.
 - netlify.toml ensures that package versions used to build the site locally match those used for deployment on Netlify (see https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/).
 - content/authors/admin/avatar contains the beautiful portrait of me gracing the home page.
 - content/authors/admin/_index.md contains the content for the home page, including main text, interests, and contain icons/links.
 - config/_default/menus.toml sets up the top bar menu links.
 - themes/hugo-academic/asset/images/icon.png to set favicon (icon appearing in tab view of browser).

old/ contains some previous attempts to launch this site, as well as the HTML files for my Northwestern postdoc website (previously at faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~esc642)
